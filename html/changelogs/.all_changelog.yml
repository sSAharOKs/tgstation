  silicons:
  - refactor: projectiles now use a new hit detection system that doesn't rely on
      quirks in movement code to work, and is easier(?) to work with
  - refactor: pass_flags_self now handles determining if something with specific pass_flags
      can cross something, by default.
  - bugfix: 'piercing projectiles (see: penetrating snipers) work again'
  - tweak: projectile permutated/impacted list is reset on ricochets, meaning reflected
      projectiles can potentially hit something again if it pierced it the first time.

  - code_imp: moved the burned_fuel amount around so its tidier.

  ATHATH:
  - rscadd: You can now make a damp rag from a bolt of cloth by using it on a sink,
      just like how you can make a damp rag by using a strip of gauze on a sink. The
      ability to stackcraft damp rags from bolts of cloth has not been removed.
  Fikou:
  - bugfix: fixes wizard corpses not having beards
  Gamer025:
  - bugfix: The help emote will no longer tell you that you cant use is
  - code_imp: Ghosts can now use the help emote and emotes generally behave like they
      normally would instead of being posted into death chat
  - bugfix: Crack emote no longer runtimes when trying to be used by ghosts
  NotRanged:
  - refactor: Changed a lot of blob code backend around, making it easier to mess
      with balance and work with in the future.

  - rscadd: Adds tactical chairs
  - bugfix: Floors now properly select a destruction method to use when blown up
  - bugfix: you can no longer put things in a griddle wrong

  necromanceranne:
  - balance: Turns the Duffel Bag Curse into a melee spell, with significant rebalances
      and changes to rework the spell for being a melee spell.
  - balance: Dealing with the duffel bag is slightly more easy, but it inflicts you
      with a lot of fairly disruptive debuffs while attached, and not dealing with
      the bag will hurt quite a bit.
  - tweak: Tidies up some of the living duffel bag code.
  - rscadd: Replaces improvised shotguns with Pipeguns (with a special variant for
      those willing to go through arbitrary bullshit to acquire it and sheer good
      luck).
  - rscadd: Now all guns can be set to misfire and swap ammunition.
  - rscadd: Misfire chance is incremental as you fire the weapon, and not a flat static
      chance. This can be reset by using a piece of cloth on the gun and 10 seconds
      of cleaning.
  - balance: This has been applied to the detective revolver, but it only increments
      while using .357 bullets.
  - rscadd: Guns can have damage multipliers attached for the bullets they fire. The
      pipegun (but not the regal version) is the first example with a 75% damage output.
  - balance: The Ice Hermit now has a regal pipegun instead of a Mosin Nagant.
  - balance: The bandolier fits 7.62mm.
  - balance: You can construct receivers and rifle stocks in the crafting menu.
  - balance: Detaches the magical rifles from the boltaction subtype, since they are
      just basically not using any variables attached to that subtype and made from
      a series of early returns.
  - balance: Changes the carrying traits on Latex/Nitrile gloves into a skillchip.
  - balance: Medical doctors start the round with a quick carry skillchip (was the
      latex glove trait).
  - balance: Paramedics and the CMO start the round with a quicker carry skillchip
      (was the nitrile glove trait).
2021-02-05:
  AnturK:
  - rscadd: Aquarium fish now reproduce.
  Fikou:
  - refactor: Refactors CTF pickups and mine powerup subtypes into a new powerup system!
  - code_imp: simple animals no longer reset their icon file on death
  Jared-Fogle:
  - rscadd: Dynamic now rolls a separate budget for round start and midround antagonists,
      meaning less round start antags will roll in favor of more midround ones.
  - admin: The antag_cap value now uses an equation that scales with population, rather
      than a fixed array.
  - admin: autotraitor_cooldown now uses deciseconds rather than ticks, so the older
      value of 450 now means 45 seconds. Set it to be 9000 if you want it to be accurate
      to the old value (15 minutes), or simply unset it.
  - admin: Midround/latejoin dynamic timers are now configurable.
  - admin: Syndicate Sleeper Agent will now give details when ti fails.
  - bugfix: The autotraitor cooldown now respects configuration, rather than resetting
      back to 15 minutes after it is rolled.
