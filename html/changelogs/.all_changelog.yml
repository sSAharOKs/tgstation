  Ryll/Shaps:
  - rscadd: You'll now get messages when you're bleeding telling you roughly how much
      blood you're losing and whether the bloodloss is getting better, worse, or holding
      steady.
  - tweak: Burn wounds will slowly heal their flesh as long as the limb has < 10 burn
      damage, the burn has no infection, and the patient is fed.
  - balance: Hearts now decay slower, failing after roughly 6 minutes instead of 4.
      Livers and stomachs fail a bit faster than before now, while lungs fail a bit
      slower, meaning they won't all fail at the same time
  - balance: Epipen coagulant will no longer clot all bleeding wounds at the same
      time. Coagulant now slows bleeding by 30%, and will only clot the wound currently
      losing the most blood. Determination from suffering wounds will slow bleeding
      by an additional 15%.

      It now reduces bleeding by 50% rather than 90%, and costs twice as much.
