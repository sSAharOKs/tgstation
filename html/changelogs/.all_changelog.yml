  - rscadd: Adds purity mechanics for reactions - if a purity extremely low at the
      end of a reaction then it will convert into viscous sludge or a failed chem.
      When a reagent is consumed; If a reagent is very impure it will inverse into
      another chem. This inversion will remove all of the original chem and take its
      place instead. If it's slightly impure then it will split into an impure chem
      with respect to purity. The ratio of original to impure is determined by the
      purity of the original when consumed.
  - rscadd: 'Adds the following basic impure reagents to accommodate the changes above:
      Chemical isomers, Toxic sludge and Viscous sludge.'
  - rscadd: Acidic and basic buffers. These will self-consume when added to a reagent
      holder will other reagents in it, and alter the pH towards their respective
      extreme. Thereby altering the pH without affecting the volume. adds; Optional
      catalysts - these reagents will speed up the reaction of a certain type. Presently
      Palladium synthate catalyst exists and works on medicine reagents only.
  - rscadd: Competitive reactions - Tempomyocin and Purity tester are reactions that
      compete based off temperature. Tempomyocin is a reagent that will instantly
      speed up a reaction based off its purity and the purity tester reagent will
      fizzle if the solution it is added to has anything impure in it.
  - rscadd: Adds an overheat/impure mechanic during reactions - overheating your reaction
      past it's overheat point will reduce the yield of your product by 2% per tick,
      with some reactions having special explosions instead. If overly impure it will
      reduce the purity of all reagents present in the beaker.
  - rscadd: 1 dropper and 1 bottle of acidic buffer (you can make this) to the chemist's
      locker. Gives chemists a starting dropper and random buffer. Added pH booklets
      to the chemists chemdrobe - these can tell you the pH of a beaker by ripping
      a sheet out of them and using it on a beaker or reagent holder
  - rscadd: Adds a pH meter than can be researched and printed from the med lathe.
      When used on a reagent holder it will tell you a detailed breakdown of the reagents
      in the beaker, including pH, volume and purity. It will also detect ongoing
      reactions.
  - rscadd: Adds pH to all reagents - the pH of a beaker/holder will be the sum of
      all reagents with respect to volume. pH is an abstracted potential of hydrogen
      that affects reactions.
  - tweak: "heavily edited the chem heater into a reaction chamber, showing multiple\
      \ details on a reaction, edited chem master and chem dispenser\u2019s UI to\
      \ show pH."
  - tweak: "You can now use droppers and syringes directly on heaters to affect the\
      \ beaker inside of it (provided there\u2019s a beaker in there)"
  - tweak: Tweaks most reagents to use a default handler. The ones omitted are ones
      that rely on being instant. This default has a minimum reaction temperature
      of 100, an optimal temperature of 500 and an overheat temperature of 900+. Their
      optimal pH range is 5-9; which will result in a purity 1 reagent when kept within
      this window. If the reaction is within a pH window of 1-4 or 9-13 the resulting
      purity will be dependent on the deviation from 5 or 9. <1 or >14 will create
      impure chems for every step. If your final purity on the end of a reaction is
      less than 0.15, then it will collapse into Viscous sludge. The reaction is mildly
      exothermic and H+ consuming.
  - tweak: tweaks chocolate milk, firefighting foam and hercuri reactions to work
      better with the new mechanics. These inherit the same pH windows as above but
      are cold reactions instead.
  - soundadd: added several sound effects for chemistry
  - imageadd: added melting beaker icons, pHbooklets and pHmeters
  - code_imp: changed reagents code, created equilibrium.dm
  - refactor: refactored main chemistry mechanics to use reaction rates, pH and purity
      mechanics
  Timberpoes:
  - bugfix: Windows are now much less stubborn when you accidentally find yourself
      inside them (*blushes*) and will let you step off their turf to the South when
      you were prevented from doing so before.
  - admin: Re-added the button to the player playtime panel that lets admins toggle
      a player's job playtime exemption status.
  - bugfix: The wizard's immovable rod form no longer deals variable damage depending
      on the number of objects on the turfs it's passing through. It instead deals
      full damage to everything it hits and hits everything on the turf at the same
      time.
  - balance: The wizard's immovable rod from can now impact with any other immovable
      rod to create a singularity. This probably kills the wizard. This definitely
      kills the rod.
  - balance: The wizard's immovable rod from can now hit mobs that are lying on the
      floor.
  - balance: The wizard's immovable rod form is now incorporeal and flying.
  - balance: The wizard's immovable rod form is now much, must faster - Especially
      when hitting multiple targets.
  - balance: The wizard's immovable rod form deals a LOT more damage to non-mobs that
      it passes through.
  - bugfix: The immovable rod no longer deals variable damage depending on the number
      of objects on the turfs it's passing through. It instead deals full damage to
      everything it hits and hits everything on the turf at the same time.
  - balance: The immovable rod can now impact with any other immovable rod to create
      a singularity. This definitely kills the rod.
  - balance: The immovable rod can now hit mobs that are lying on the floor.
  - balance: The immovable rod is now incorporeal and flying.
  - balance: The immovable rod is now much, must faster - Especially when hitting
      multiple targets.
  - balance: 'The immovable rod deals a LOT more damage to non-mobs that it passes
      through. feature: The immovable rod can now traverse z-level to chase its targets
      down when used as both a targetted smite and as an option from the admin event
      menu. feature: The immovable rod will subtly grow as it consumes the souls of
      sentients it hits.'
  - bugfix: The immovable rod no longer stalls on Icebox and will now spawn on the
      same z-level as its destination.
  coiax:
  - tweak: Shift start messes in cargo can now include package scraps, the same sort
      of stuff you get when opening packages.
  - tweak: The Jolly and Depression quirks are much more active. You can expect the
      positive/negative moodlets to affect you around 50% of the time.
  - tweak: Goldschlager will have the same effect of gold when drunk; it is around
      9% gold in SS13.
  - tweak: Goldschlager is now only really enjoyed by teenage girls, others will think
      it's not bad, but not great.
  necromanceranne:
  - bugfix: Fixes harpoon guns jamming because they're a child of the mosin nagant.
  - bugfix: You can print more than a single sheet of tape at a time.
