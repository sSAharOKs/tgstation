  ATHATH:
  - rscadd: You can now make a damp rag from a bolt of cloth by using it on a sink,

  Fikou:
  - bugfix: fixes wizard corpses not having beards
  Gamer025:
  - bugfix: The help emote will no longer tell you that you cant use is

  necromanceranne:
  - balance: Turns the Duffel Bag Curse into a melee spell, with significant rebalances
      and changes to rework the spell for being a melee spell.
  - balance: Dealing with the duffel bag is slightly more easy, but it inflicts you
      with a lot of fairly disruptive debuffs while attached, and not dealing with
      the bag will hurt quite a bit.
  - tweak: Tidies up some of the living duffel bag code.
  - rscadd: Replaces improvised shotguns with Pipeguns (with a special variant for
      those willing to go through arbitrary bullshit to acquire it and sheer good
      luck).
  - rscadd: Now all guns can be set to misfire and swap ammunition.
  - rscadd: Misfire chance is incremental as you fire the weapon, and not a flat static
      chance. This can be reset by using a piece of cloth on the gun and 10 seconds
      of cleaning.
  - balance: This has been applied to the detective revolver, but it only increments
      while using .357 bullets.
  - rscadd: Guns can have damage multipliers attached for the bullets they fire. The
      pipegun (but not the regal version) is the first example with a 75% damage output.
  - balance: The Ice Hermit now has a regal pipegun instead of a Mosin Nagant.
  - balance: The bandolier fits 7.62mm.
  - balance: You can construct receivers and rifle stocks in the crafting menu.

      a series of early returns.
  - balance: Changes the carrying traits on Latex/Nitrile gloves into a skillchip.
  - balance: Medical doctors start the round with a quick carry skillchip (was the
      latex glove trait).

      (was the nitrile glove trait).

  - refactor: Refactors CTF pickups and mine powerup subtypes into a new powerup system!
  - code_imp: simple animals no longer reset their icon file on death
  Jared-Fogle:
  - rscadd: Dynamic now rolls a separate budget for round start and midround antagonists,
      meaning less round start antags will roll in favor of more midround ones.
  - admin: The antag_cap value now uses an equation that scales with population, rather
      than a fixed array.
  - admin: autotraitor_cooldown now uses deciseconds rather than ticks, so the older
      value of 450 now means 45 seconds. Set it to be 9000 if you want it to be accurate
      to the old value (15 minutes), or simply unset it.
  - admin: Midround/latejoin dynamic timers are now configurable.
  - admin: Syndicate Sleeper Agent will now give details when ti fails.
  - bugfix: The autotraitor cooldown now respects configuration, rather than resetting
      back to 15 minutes after it is rolled.

  - refactor: The Plant Analyzer was re-written to unify output formatting.
  - code_imp: A bunch of botany related things now use defines for their minimums
      and maximums.
  - code_imp: Plants now almost entirely use the setter/adjuster procs to change their

      a minimum endurance of 10 instead of 0 as a consequence but they're functionally
      almost identical.
